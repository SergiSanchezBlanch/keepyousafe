               <h2>History of Halloween</h2>
               <p class="parrafo">Known as Halloween, it is a modern celebration resulting from the syncretism originated by the Christianization of the end of summer festival of Celtic origin called Samhain.<br><br>
                It is celebrated internationally on the <span class="destacado">night of October 31</span>, especially in the Anglo-sphere, such as Canada, the United States, Ireland or the United Kingdom, and, to a lesser extent, in other places such as Spain and Latin America. Despite belonging to the Anglo-Saxon world, in Australia5 and New Zealand this custom is not observed as much as in the other countries.<br><br>
                <span class="destacado">Its roots are linked to the Celtic commemoration of Samhain and the Christian holiday of All Saints' Day, celebrated by Catholics on November 1.</span><br><br> It is a secular celebration, although some consider that it has a religious background. Irish immigrants transmitted versions of the tradition to North America during the Great Irish Famine.
                The day is often associated with the colors orange, black and purple and is strongly linked to symbols such as the jack-o'-lantern. The typical activities of Halloween are the famous trick or treat and the parties of disguises, in addition to the bonfires, the visit of enchanted houses, the jokes, the reading of histories of fear and the viewing of terror films.
